# Programming Basics: Comparison Operators

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with the comparison operators.

### Instructions
- work in `solution.js`
- Print all your results to the console

0. Declare two variables `apples` and `oranges`. Assign a value of 20 to `apples`. Assign a value of 30 to `oranges`.

1. Check whether `apples` and `oranges` are equal.

2. Check whether `apples` and `oranges` are *not* equal.

3. Check whether `apples` is greater than `oranges`.

4. Check whether `apples` is less than or equal to `oranges`.

5. Check whether `oranges` is greater than `apples`.

6. Declare another variable `mangoes` and give it a value of 5. Multiply `mangoes` by `apples`, and check whether this result is greater than `mangoes` added to `oranges`.

7. Subtract `mangoes` from `apples` and check whether this result is less than `oranges` divided by `mangoes`.

8. Check whether `mangoes`, `apples` and `oranges` are equal.

9. Check whether the remainder of `apples` divided by `mangoes` and the remainder of `oranges` divided by `mangoes` are equal.

10. Check whether `mangoes` added to `apples` is greater than `oranges` minus `mangoes`. If it is not, find an operator which will give a result of true.

11. BONUS CHALLENGE: Try increasing script readability by adding question headings to your output before each result.

# Programming Basics: Logical Operators

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with logical operators. **Print all your checks to the console. Make sure that you are using the *correct* logical operator.**

0. Declare two variables: `isDogBetter` with the value of `true`, and `isCatBetter` with the value of `false`.

1. Check the result of:

- a) isDogBetter AND isCatBetter.

- b) isDogBetter OR isCatBetter.

- c) NOT (isDogBetter AND isCatBetter).

2. Declare three more variables `atoms`, `sandGrains`, `starsInSky`. Give these variables number values.

3. Check the result of whether:

- a) `atoms` is greater than `starsInSky` AND `atoms` is greater than `sandGrains`.

- b) `atoms` is NOT equal to `sandGrains`.

- c) `starsInSky` is less than `sandGrains` OR `starsInSky` is greater than `atoms`.

- d) `atoms` is equal to `starsInSky` OR `atoms` is NOT equal to `sandGrains`.

- e) `atoms` is greater than or equal to 10 AND `sandGrains` is less than or equal to 10.

- f) `atoms` multiplied by `starsInSky` is less than 100 OR whether `atoms` multiplied by `sandGrains` is greater than 100.

4. BONUS: In your own words, explain the logic of each result in a comment after the result.
